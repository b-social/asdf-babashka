[babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com).

</div>

Note: this fork of Frederic Merizen's excellent asdf-babashka was created in order to fix an issue on Apple Silicon. Because the [original Github project](https://github.com/fredZen/asdf-babashka) wasn't updated in 2 years, we decided to fix the issue in this fork.

We intend to maintain this fork going forward – if you notice any problems please file an issue.
